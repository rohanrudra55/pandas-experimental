# Pandas Experimental

This is a mini project on pandas. It will help to learn the basics and get familiar with fundamentals.

### Problem Statement

The "data" folder contains some folders, within which there are some files with unique names and time stamps. You have to generate a "data.csv" file. The column name will be the internal folder name, and the rows will have the file names sorted, including the extension, depending on the time stamp and the name.

Also there should be a feature to manually select the inner folder and output file location.

Note : Maintain the location hierarchy.
